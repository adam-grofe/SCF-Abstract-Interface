# SCF-Abstract-Interface
This is a section of code in the Chronus Quantum software package that was
largely written by me to allow the SCF interface to be more general.
Prior to this refactor, a different SCF function was written for each 
method. However, this generalization allowed the same algorithms to be
applied to all of our methods so far. 

Since this is only a small segment of the overall code, you can find
the rest of the code at https://urania.chem.washington.edu/chronusq/chronusq_public
